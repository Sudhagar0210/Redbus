Redbus Data Scraping and Filtering with Streamlit Application


Project Overview

The "Redbus Data Scraping and Filtering with Streamlit Application" project aims to enhance the transportation industry by automating the collection, analysis, and visualization of bus travel data. This solution leverages Selenium for web scraping to extract detailed information from Redbus, including bus routes, schedules, prices, and seat availability. The data is then stored in a SQL database and made accessible through a user-friendly Streamlit application for interactive filtering and analysis.


Business Use Cases

This project can be beneficial in various scenarios, such as:

  * Travel Aggregators: Provide real-time bus schedules and seat availability to customers.
  * Market Analysis: Analyze travel patterns and preferences for market research.
  * Customer Service: Improve user experience by offering customized travel options based on data insights.
  * Competitor Analysis: Compare pricing and service levels with competitors.


Approach

Data Scraping

1. Utilize Selenium to automate the extraction of data from Redbus, including:
  * Bus routes
  * Bus Route Links
  * Bus Type
  * Prices (Fare)
  * Seat availability
  * Starting Time
  * Duration
  * Bust Rating

Streamlit Application

1. Develop a Streamlit application to display and filter the data.
  Implement filters such as:
     * Bus routes
    * Bus Route Links
    * Bus Type
    * Prices (Fare)
    * Seat availability
    * Starting Time
    * Duration
    * Bust Rating


Data Analysis/Filtering

  1. Use SQL queries to retrieve and filter data based on user inputs.
  2. Allow users to interact with and filter data through the Streamlit application.

Results

* The project aims to achieve the following:-
  
  1. Successfully scrape data for at least 10 Government State Bus Transport services from the Redbus website, along with private bus information for selected routes.
  2. Store the data in a well-structured SQL database.
  3. Develop an interactive and user-friendly Streamlit application for data filtering and visualization.

















Data Storage

* Store the scraped data in a structured SQL database for efficient querying and management.
